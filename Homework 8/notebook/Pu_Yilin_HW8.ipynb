    "#### iv. Spectral Clustering: Repeat 1(b)iii using spectral clustering, which is clus- tering based on kernels.3 Research what spectral clustering is. Use RBF kernel with gamma=1 or find a gamma for which the two clutsres have the same balance as the one in original data set (if the positive class has p and the negative class has n samples, the two clusters must have p and n members). Do not label data based on their proximity to cluster center, because spectral clustering may give you non-convex clusters . Instead, use fit − predict method."
